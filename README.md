# Salon Luxe Website

This project is the original Salon Luxe website, created as my first full website project. It showcases a luxury hair salon with a simple, elegant design and core functionality. This version demonstrates my early web development skills and focuses on a clean, responsive layout with essential features.

## My process
For this project, I focused on planning the structure of a one-page site and implementing a clean, functional layout. My process included:

1. Planning the one-page layout with sections for hero, services, stylists, and contact.

2. Writing semantic HTML for content organization.

3. Styling the site with CSS, using Flexbox and Grid for layout.

4. Adding interactivity with vanilla JavaScript, including smooth scroll and contact form handling.

5. Optimizing images for fast loading and responsive display.

6. Testing responsiveness across multiple devices.
